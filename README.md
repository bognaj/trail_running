# Trail_running

All the materials and programms used during writing my master thesis.

## src folder content
* **idea.ipynb** - some ideas about directions in which the research can go. Definitely to be further discussed and verified.
* **example.ipynb** - verification of the functions calculating the metabolic energy expenditure. Data coming from Strava Sauce browser extension, 
containing already calculated grade, velocity and cumulated distance.
* **summarized_gpx_slope.ipynb** - interpolation of the route altitudes with linear functions (to get the slope at each distance point). 
Potentially useful in case of calculating the integral.
